# Bundled PySide6 runtime (placeholder)

Phase 0 commits a ready-to-import Android Studio project. The PySide6 runtime
assets are staged here so Gradle can package them without needing to rerun the
Qt deployment tooling. Replace these placeholders with the actual PySide6
Android deployment output when generating a production build.
