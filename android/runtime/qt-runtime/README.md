# Legacy Qt runtime placeholders

The Android app is now a native **Kotlin** project and does not load Qt or
PySide6. This directory remains only as historical scaffolding from the prior
experiments and is **not** consumed by the current Gradle build. You can ignore
these placeholder `.so` files when building or debugging the Kotlin app.
